/**
 * Declarative constraints over a solved palette.
 *
 * Every constraint reports a SIGNED slack in its own natural unit — contrast
 * ratio points, or L units. That gives three states rather than two:
 *
 *   violated  slack < -tol
 *   binding   |slack| <= tol      <- the important one
 *   satisfied otherwise
 *
 * "Binding" deserves its own rendering because three of these sit at zero slack
 * in the shipped palette. That is where the design is fragile: any change to a
 * knob feeding a binding constraint breaks it immediately, and a UI that shows
 * only pass/fail hides that entirely.
