/**
 * Why there is no early exit on bracket width — this was tried and measured.
 *
 * The reasoning looked airtight: every residual here is a function of an 8-bit
 * hex, so it is a staircase; one LSB of lightness is ~1/255 ≈ 3.9e-3; a bracket
 * narrower than that cannot distinguish two answers; so stopping at 1e-5 should be
 * exact and would cut the 40 halvings to ~16. `worst()` costs 7 families × 2
 * `cmaxFor` calls × ~15 gamut tests, so that read as thousands of wasted tests per
 * solve.
 *
 * It is wrong, and the fidelity harness caught it. Because the residual is a
 * staircase, bisection converges onto the BOUNDARY between two plateaus, and
 * stopping 1e-5 short can leave `mid` on the far side of it. Measured against the
 * shipped palette: byte-exact rungs fell from 57 to 54, and C6 — contrast(grey 800,
 * grey 200) ≥ 4.5 — went from binding to **violated at −0.047**. The extra
 * halvings are not refining digits nobody can see; they are what pins the answer to
 * the correct step of the staircase.
 *
 * And the premise was false anyway: a full solve is 2.7 ms. There was nothing to
 * buy. Do not reintroduce this without running `npm run fidelity`.
 *
 * The one guard that IS free is the finiteness check below.
