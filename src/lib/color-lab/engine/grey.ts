/**
 * Grey: a fully independent 10-rung scale.
 *
 * Shape: a degressive light end, then a uniform tail. That shape is not an
 * aesthetic choice — it is the only one that buys contrast(800,200) >= 4.5
 * with #F9F9FA and #344563 both locked. A perfectly uniform step across all
 * ten rungs only reaches 4.3, so any rebalancing toward the light end breaks
 * the constraint.
 *
 * Derivation:
 *   1. L100, L1000 <- the two anchors.
 *   2. L200 <- L100 - step100 (free parameter).
 *   3. L800 <- SOLVED from contrast(800, 200) >= target. Binding at 4.501.
 *   4. The five rungs between 200 and 800 are distributed to equalise the two
 *      cadence breaks, by solving d2 = sqrt(d1 * d3) subject to
 *      d2 + 5*d3 = L200 - L800. One unknown, monotone -> bisection.
 *   5. L900, L1000 <- two even steps from L800 down to the 1000 anchor.
 *
 * The key that unlocks all of this: contrast(800,200) = 4.5 is a MINIMUM, not
 * a target. That is what allows the 200 to lift and the light end to go
 * degressive. Treat it as an equality and the 200's L is fully determined and
 * there is no lever left.
 *
 * Three failed approaches, recorded so they are not retried:
 *   - Re-solving everything to lighten the 300: cadence gets WORSE (1.84x ->
 *     2.05x), because the 4.5 constraint lifts the 200 alongside the 300.
 *   - Lightening the 300 alone: 200->300 improves to 1.34x but 300->400 climbs
 *     to 2.12x and the steps stop being monotone.
 *   - A constant-ratio geometric step over all ten rungs: perfectly smooth
 *     cadence, but contrast(800,200) collapses to 2.83. Unusable.
