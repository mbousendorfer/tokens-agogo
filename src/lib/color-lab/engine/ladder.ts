/**
 * The shared chromatic ladder of L values, rungs 100..800.
 *
 * The derivation is a chain, and the order is load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. L700 <- the lightness of the purple anchor #6554c0. This is the fact
 *      that drives the whole scale. #6554c0 fell 70% of the way between the
 *      old 600 and 700, so no invisible approximation was available; the
 *      decision was to re-seat the ladder so that rung 700 IS its lightness.
 *   2. L500 <- the mean of the two brand anchors' lightness. Both anchors
 *      therefore sit OFF this ladder, by -0.0271 and +0.0272.
 *   3. lowStep <- (L500 - L700) / divisor. Gives 600 and 800.
 *   4. L200 is SOLVED, not chosen: the smallest L that holds
 *      contrast(700, 200) >= target across every family. Green binds it,
 *      because green is the lightest hue at equal L.
 *   5. highStep <- (L200 - L500) / divisor. Gives 300 and 400.
 *   6. L100 <- L200 + step100. A knob with a target, not a derivation.
 *
 * Consequence worth remembering before "fixing" anything here: the interval
 * 500->700 is NOT subdivisible. Inserting a rung there lifts 700 to L 0.5702,
 * where green-700 on green-200 falls to 3.66. That is also the most commonly
 * requested addition (intermediate hover/active states), so it is the one
 * addition the constraints forbid.
